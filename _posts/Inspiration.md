## **My Inspirations and Influences in 3D Art**

Ever since I was a kid, I've been drawn to art. There's something magical about how humans represent feelings and ideas through various mediums. This fascination led me to 3D art, where I could really push the boundaries of creativity. My journey started with learning to draw and figuring out how 3D tools work. It was all about gradually leveling up my skills and understanding how to turn my ideas into reality.

### **The Evolution of My Art Journey**

At first, I had to get the hang of the technical stuff. I took all sorts of courses, from the super technical to those that helped me figure out which ideas were worth pursuing. As my technique improved, so did my thoughts about art. It was crucial to not only have great ideas but also the skills to execute them well. **Balancing technique and creativity became key for me**.

### **Logic, Empathy, and the Philosophical Approach**

I love being logical and objective. **Understanding the difference between good and evil** and fighting against the bad stuff has always been important to me. I try to look beyond the obvious, empathize with different viewpoints, and figure out if an idea is truly meaningful or just mediocre. This mix of philosophical thinking and introspection really shapes my art style.

### **The Role of Abstract Forms and Dark Themes**

Abstract forms, especially cables, have always caught my eye. They give me a unique feeling, and I was determined to learn how to incorporate them into my 3D work. Plus, I'm really drawn to depicting spirits or ghosts, often shown as deformed humans, kind of like Dementors from Harry Potter or the **Nazgul from The Lord of the Rings**. These characters embody darkness and complexity, and I find them super interesting, even if I can't fully explain why.

### **Integrating Philosophical Ideas**

I aim to blend this kind of art with philosophical ideas about life, **introspection**, and societal issues. I want my work to tackle important, often uncomfortable topics. Combining dark aesthetics with deep, thought-provoking themes allows me to create art that's both visually striking and intellectually stimulating.

### **Music and Its Influence**

Music is a huge influence on my work too. I listen to a **wide range of genres**, but my favourite is techno and rap, depending on my mood i chancge to other genres. I draw a lot of inspiration from how musicians convey emotions and stories through their music. Their dedication and ability to evoke feelings through sound parallel my own goals in art.

### **Analyzing Human Behavior**

I'm really into philosophy and psychology, and this definitely influences my art. I constantly analyze people, their **unconscious thoughts**, motivations, and problems. Empathy is crucial for me, not just as a moral principle but as an obsession. I study various philosophical and psychological theories to better understand the world and its people, and this introspection shows up in my work.

### **Architecture and Its Impact**

Architecture, especially Gothic and Baroque styles, fascinates me. The powerful emotions these styles evoke through their forms and structures are incredible. The play of light, shadow, and space in these architectural styles inspires my 3D creations.

### **Nature's Beauty and Complexity**

Nature is another big influence. The world's ability to create both beautiful and terrifying things is astonishing. Natural phenomena, like trees, rivers, and natural forces, inspire my work. I believe that beauty lies in imperfection, and this concept is a big part of my art.

### **The Role of Technology**

I see **technology as a human-made counterpart** to nature. The complexity and coherence of technology, from films to solutions for world problems, also influence my art. Technology represents human ingenuity and our quest to create and control our environment.

### **Continuous Learning and Experimentation**

I'm passionate about learning from others, the world around me, and the art community. This constant quest for knowledge shapes my artistic style. Combining architecture, abstract forms, and elements of nature, I strive to create original and thought-provoking art. My goal is to create a world where these forms coexist, a dimension where these beings feel real.

Thank you for reading. I'm sure there are aspects I haven't fully explained, but I wanted to share my inspirations and influences. I'll delve deeper into these topics in future articles.
